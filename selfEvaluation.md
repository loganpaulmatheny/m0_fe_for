# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement? **Feeling good!**
- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle? **Mostly productive struggle. I enjoyed re-learning and practicing with for loops since I haven't been using them for a while. I also found the `startsWith()` method!**
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that? **Nothing at the moment! **
- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need? **None at this time **
